## 1. 🚀 **Project Introduction**

This project is a complete **SQL-based analysis** of a pizza store’s sales dataset.
The objective was to extract meaningful insights using only SQL queries — no dashboards, no visualization libraries, just **pure database analysis**.

The dataset covers orders, pizzas, categories, and pricing, allowing for real-world business questions like:

* What are the best-selling pizzas?
* Which pizza category earns the most revenue?
* What time of day has the highest demand?
* How does revenue grow over time?

This mirrors the type of analysis performed by data analysts in real business environments using SQL exclusively.

## 2. 🗂️ **Dataset Overview**

The project uses **four relational tables**:

| Table Name      | Description                                     |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `pizzas`        | Contains pizza size, price, and type reference  |
| `pizza_types`   | Contains category and description of each pizza |
| `orders`        | Tracks order timestamps                         |
| `order_details` | Stores pizza quantities for each order          |

This structure allows complex JOINs, aggregations, and time-based analysis.

## 3. 🔍 **Key Analysis Highlights**

### ✔ **1. Total Orders & Total Revenue**

Calculated the overall number of orders and the total revenue generated by the business.

### ✔ **2. Best-Selling Pizzas**

Ranked pizzas by:

* Quantity sold
* Revenue generated

### ✔ **3. Top Categories & Size Performance**

Analyzed:

* Best-selling pizza categories (e.g., Classic, Veggie, Supreme)
* Performance of pizza sizes (S, M, L, XL)

### ✔ **4. Hourly & Daily Sales Trends**

Extracted insights such as:

* Most popular order hours
* Sales distribution across days of the week

### ✔ **5. Cumulative Revenue**

Used window functions to compute:

* Running revenue total
* Revenue growth pattern over time

## 4. 🧠 **SQL Techniques Used**

This project includes practical use of:

* `JOIN` (INNER, LEFT)
* `GROUP BY`
* `ORDER BY`
* `WHERE` filtering
* `LIMIT`
* **Subqueries**
* **Window Functions** (`RANK()`, `ROW_NUMBER()`, `SUM() OVER`)
* Aggregate functions (`SUM`, `COUNT`, `AVG`)
* Date and time extraction (`HOUR()`, `DAYNAME()`)

All insights were derived using SQL queries written and executed in **MySQL**.

## 5. 📘 **Full Project Explanation (Deep Dive)**

### 🔹 **1. Understanding the Schema**

The first step was exploring the relationships between tables.
Keys like `pizza_id`, `pizza_type_id`, and `order_id` enable meaningful JOINs that combine pricing, category, and order details.

---

### 🔹 **2. Data Exploration**

Initial queries were written to check:

* Row counts
* Unique pizza types
* Pricing variations
* Timestamp patterns

This ensures the dataset is understood before deriving insights.

---

### 🔹 **3. Revenue Calculations**

Revenue is calculated as:

```
price * quantity
```

This required a **multi-table JOIN** between:

* `order_details`
* `pizzas`
* `pizza_types`
* `orders`

---

### 🔹 **4. Best-Selling Pizza Analysis**

Two separate metrics were calculated:

1️⃣ **By Quantity Sold**
2️⃣ **By Revenue Contribution**

Window functions like `RANK()` were used to identify top performers.

---

### 🔹 **5. Time-Based Insights**

Using MySQL datetime functions, we extracted:

* Hour of day (`HOUR(order_time)`)
* Day of week (`DAYNAME(order_date)`)

This revealed peak business hours and weekly demand cycles.

---

### 🔹 **6. Cumulative Revenue**

A running total of revenue was computed using:

```
SUM(revenue) OVER (ORDER BY order_date)
```

This provides a business-level understanding of revenue progression.

---

## 6. 🏁 **Outcome**

This project strengthened core SQL skills including:

* Writing complex queries
* Performing business-oriented analysis
* Understanding relational schemas
* Applying analytical thinking using SQL alone

It simulates the type of tasks performed by data analysts and business intelligence teams in real organizations.

---

## 7. 🔮 **Future Enhancements**

* Add more KPIs like average order value
* Perform customer segmentation (if customer data available)
* Build a dashboard version using a visualization tool (Power BI/Tableau/Streamlit)
* Add monthly or seasonal trend analysis
